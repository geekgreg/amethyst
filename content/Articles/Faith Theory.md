Any attempt to explain your faith could be called your "Faith Theory." Like all theories, them more it can explain, the better it is.

An example of a bad Faith Theory might be "It's all a lie." You might accept this theory because it explains some problems you've discovered with your faith. But any good Faith Theory must be able to explain as much as possible. "It's all a lie" can't explain the [very real miracles that follow the believers](https://www.latterdayhope.com/). 

Similarly, "It's all true" is equally bad, because it can't explain the very real problems that we face in our religion.

Your own Faith Theory is going to be built over time, bit by bit, and will need adjustment from time to time, just like a real scientific theory. As you learn new things you will refine your theories and hopefully find more and more truth.

> [!example] I often use the tern "explanatory power" when talking about people's theories for the church, our doctrines, and the members.  A good theory has to explain the most variables possible - have good "explanatory power." If one of our variables is that [[Things We're Sure Of | God Loves Us]], then any theory has to take that into account to be truly viable.

Our "faith theory" has to not just explain the faults in the Book of Mormon with the simple "it's all made up" but it has to explain the incredible evidences FOR authenticity. Neither "It's **all** a lie" nor "it's **all** divine" can do that.

Our faith theory has to solve as much of the good and the bad that hangs over our belief system. To me, God choosing broken, flawed people to do his work is the only explanation that can account for the simultaneous divinity and brokenness of the restored gospel.
