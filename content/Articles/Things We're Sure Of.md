When it comes to the restored gospel there are a lot of things that we call [[Doctrine | Doctrine]] but not everybody agrees on what is doctrine and what isn't. That means there's a bit of uncertainty or ambiguity, even on subjects that many of us feel are settled.

With that in mind, what are some teachings about which we feel at least somewhat certain? What are some things that can serve as a foundation for subjects of faith as well as for logical questioning and exploration of the restored gospel? 

## A Few "Core Doctrines" on Which We Can Hang Our Hats:

* God is real
* God loves us
* God is fair
* The priesthood is real
* Revelation is real
* We have agency
* The scriptures can be a conduit for revelation
* The scriptures can help us navigate our lives
* The scriptures point us to Christ
* Life has pupose and meaning
* The Creation
* The Fall
* The Atonement
* The Pre-Existence
* The spirit world
* The Resurrection
* Judgement
* God requires sacrifice from us
* God gives commandments 
* We can speak to God through prayer
* We worship God the Father in the name of Jesus Christ
* Jesus Christ is our Savior from Sin and Death
* Everyone requires repentance
* Joseph Smith was a prophet

## How do these "Core Doctrines" help us?

These things might serve as a part of our "Creed of the Restored Gospel", even though [[Joseph Smith]] said we don't have any creeds. ðŸ˜• 

With these and similar items of certainty we can begin to build a framework for our faith - a sort of [[Faith Theory]] which helps us find and evaluate truth in the doctrines of the Restored Gospel.  

>[!example]
>Let's say somebody tells you that God punishes people for not knowing his rules. Because you know that God loves us and is fair that this hypothesis is wrong and we should explore the situation again with those truths in mind.

As we make our lists of certainties - our premises in our arguments - we should be very careful before adding ANYTHING to the list. Some things we have believed our whole lives have never really been questioned or examined. Stuff that seems like an "of course" can crumble in the light of unbiased scrutiny. 

> [!warning] Commandment Warning!
> It's common for our unexamined assumptions to pollute our pool of "doctrines" even when it comes to commandments. A great example is the common assumption made about the prohibition on drinking coffee and tea in the church. Too many people treat their idea that "it's because of the caffiene" as truth. But that so-called truth should not go on our list of certainties!
