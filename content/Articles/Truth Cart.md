Historian Patrick Mason created a metaphor called a "Truth Cart" which is a way of visualizing the mental and psychological space we give to things we think are true. Here's how he puts it:

> One of the problems we have in Mormonism is that we have loaded too much into the _Truth Cart_. And then when anything in the cart starts to rot a bit, or look unseemly upon further inspection, some have a tendency to _overturn the entire cart_ or seek a refund for the whole lot. We have loaded so much into the Truth Cart largely because we have wanted to have the same kind of certainty about our religious claims—down to rather obscure doctrinal issues—as we do about scientific claims. . . .  
> Over the years the church leadership and laity have also done our religion no favors by putting more in the cart than the cart could possibly bear. . . . Many of the things which trouble people are things that we probably should never have been all that dogmatic about in the first place. I find that a little humility about our doctrine, especially given the contingencies of its historical development, goes a long way in remaining satisfied with the whole. . . .  
> \[anti-mormon hit pieces\] are emblematic of this all-or-nothing approach to religion.

## How antagonists to our faith use the truth cart against us

many ex-Mormons and anti-Mormons can’t resist opportunities to tell believers what their faith “really teaches.” Hear an ex-Mormon start a sentence with “did you know” and you can almost be certain he or she is about to try and educate you on an esoteric and negatively framed artifact from our religious history. Of course, this is nonsensical, since what is a person’s faith if not what they believe? Why then, do most anti-Mormon texts seek to inform us about the “real” religion, substituting our beliefs with theirs, and filling our truth carts with [[Anti-Doctrines]]? 

They insist you must believe EVERYTHING ever said or speculated by any leader, ever (and especially the most negative interpretation of those things) or you believe NOTHING.

In essence, these people want you to believe that Mormonism must not only be everything that is true or thought to be true by yourself, but that you must load your cart high with everything ever said by an authority, throw a net over everything and bind it tightly down – allowing none of it to escape. You must place [[Doctrine | everything ever taught]] into that cart from the obscure history to the forgotten speculation of leaders past; not just the things you personally know to be true. This hurts you in two terrible ways: it makes you easier to “tip” and it makes you stop moving forward as you focus on loading your cart ever higher.

## What do we do with our wobbly Truth Carts?

Philosopher Adam Miller asks us a question about what we are thinking about our religion when things feel wobbly:

> Can you sacrifice what you *thought* was your religion as an act fidelity to that religion?  
>  
>And, then, having given it all back, having returned all your ideas about God and religion to God, can you still keep coming?  
>  
>Can you stay?  
>  
>If your religion falls apart in your hands, don’t without further ado [assume that this is because your religion doesn’t work](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/10/it-works-wonderfully?lang=eng).  
>  
>Rather, start by inquiring into whether that disintegration may not itself be the clearest manifestation yet of the fact that your religion *is* working. 

Perhaps those missing pieces or cracks in our self-made concept of religion are not to "test us" or require us to "have faith" or some other metaphysical reason, but to remove from us the responsibility of dealing with these kinds of issues at the expense of what really matters. To show us what kinds of things *should* get thrown out of the cart - away from our attention and focus.

In other words, we can't get distracted preaching to the world about our perfect leaders and our scientifically proven book and our certain doctrines if our religion is instead imperfect, unproven, and uncertain. It forces us to hang on to those things which [ARE real](https://www.latterdayhope.com/a-few-facts-about-the-latter-day-saints/), and [ARE meaningful](https://www.latterdayhope.com/a-few-facts-about-the-latter-day-saints-and-service/). 

Our religion was never about if skeletons in a field were Nephite or Mayan, or if prophets were always going to get answers to doctrinal questions right or not. It was never about the method of the translation of the Book of Mormon, or the racism or lack thereof of past members and leaders. 

Perhaps when those parts of our religion "fall apart in our hands" we can be free to realize "this isn't what I was meant to focus on" and finally open our attention to the [light that comes in through the cracks](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/tyler-j-jarvis/thats-light-gets/).
