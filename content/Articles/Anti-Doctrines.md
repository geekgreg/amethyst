## What is an "Anti-Doctrine?"

Anti-Doctrine is my term for a doctrine or teaching that is said to be part of our shared beliefs only by those who do not believe. 

"anti-doctrine" then, has a double meaning because it refers to both the opposite of doctrine - something that we **do not** teach instead of something we do teach - and it also refers to its use by "anti-Mormons"

## Common usage by antagonists to faith

These anti-doctrines are often presented as "What your religion REALLY teaches" or as some sort of secret that was covered up and never revealed to you, the unsuspecting believer. 

(insert snarky tone) How kind of the non-believer, then, to reveal what you were secretly believing all along!

## How to recognize Anti-Doctrine

Because [[Doctrine | we define doctrine as a teaching]], anything taught by church members in any positions of authority could be called "doctrine." However, Elder Neil L Anderson guides us with a better standard for finding out what "the church" teaches:

> There is an important principle that governs the doctrine of the Church. The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. True principles are taught frequently and by many.

Therefore, long-ago statements by church leaders, no matter how important they were, may not qualify as a doctrine of our faith if those statements haven't survived to be taught today by our leaders. 

In other words, "what the church really believes" is what it teaches in public today, what the majority of members actually believe, and what we practice. It's not the random thoughts, speculation, or interpretation of cherry-picked statements from other flawed humans - even when those words are found in scripture! 

## A Few Examples of Anti-Doctrine

* Mormons believe they will get their own planet
* People live on the moon and sun
* Blood atonement
* Women are destined to be making babies for eternity
* The garden of eden was in missouri
* You HAVE to be a polygamist in the next life
* Skin color is a sign of a curse
* Adam is God
* Women should not speak in church

The list goes on. Anybody trying to tell  you what "Mormons Really Believe" is making an effort to load more and more into your "Truth Cart" so it's easier for them to tip it over.
