For the purposes of this project we need to define a few common terms. One of the most common and troublesome terms used by memebers of the restored church is "Doctrine."

## How We Define Doctrine Here

Docrine literally means "teaching."  Any **current teaching** of the church is therefore a "doctrine" of the church. 

### Implications:

* Not every doctrine will be complete, up-to-date, or even true. 
* There is no difference between policy and doctrine.
* Doctrines can change, be updated, expire, etc.
* Doctrines can apply only temporarily, or to certain people.

## Why define doctrine this way?

Most members seem to think of a doctrine as something unchanging, eternal, and true. However nowhere in the church do we have any kind of guide to our doctrines. What one person insists is doctrine is called speculation by another. Where one member sees a temporary church policy, another sees permanance.

Therefore, if we're going to discuss our doctrines in an impartial way, we have to treat  them all impartially. This is the best way to do that without adding emotional or psychological baggage to our search for truth.

The hope is that we come out of this with the ability to accept all teachings equally, without downplaying some as "mere policy," or opinion. But similarly we don't have to take every word said by every prophet ever and try to force it to fit in our over-burdened "Truth Carts."   

Instead we learn a doctrine, recognize it for what it is, and rather than ask "is this doctrine?? is this true??" ask "how do I need to live?"

## The Imperminance of Doctrine

Elder Anderson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles gave wonderful guidance on one of the ways we should filter through our teachings to figure out what teachings we should accept as Church teachings, instead of opinions, speculation, or expired doctrines:

> There is an important principle that governs the doctrine of the Church. The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. True principles are taught frequently and by many.

Thus two tools we have for finding truth in our doctrines are durability and consensus. 

### Durability

Durability refers to how long a doctrine endures. For example, are modern prophets speaking about subjects that seemed important to earlier prophets? If not, those teachings lack durability. That may be a sign that those doctrines were temporary, aimed at a certain group, or just opinion rather than inspired. In a worst-case scenario, these can become [[Anti-Doctrines]].

### Consensus

Today our Church leaders have learned to find consensus on matters of policy and doctrine. Earlier leaders did not have the experience to know that the members of our faith will too easily accept opinion and speculation as eternal truth. A teaching from a single leader or a small number of leaders does not overcome the hurdle of consensus. That doesn't mean those doctrines aren't true, but it's a warning sign to dig deeper.
