The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. True principles are taught frequently and by many.\n\nTherefore, long-ago statements by church leaders, no matter how important they were, may not qualify as a doctrine of our faith if those statements haven't survived to be taught today by our leaders. \n\nIn other words, \"what the church really believes\" is what it teaches in public today, what the majority of members actually believe, and what we practice. It's not the random thoughts, speculation, or interpretation of cherry-picked statements from other flawed humans - even when those words are found in scripture! \n\n## A Few Examples of Anti-Doctrine\n\n* Mormons believe they will get their own planet\n* People live on the moon and sun\n* Blood atonement\n* Women are destined to be making babies for eternity\n* The garden of eden was in missouri\n* You HAVE to be a polygamist in the next life\n* Skin color is a sign of a curse\n* Adam is God\n* Women should not speak in church\n\nThe list goes on. Anybody trying to tell  you what \"Mormons Really Believe\" is making an effort to load more and more into your \"Truth Cart\" so it's easier for them to tip it over. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-24T20:02:56.387790613Z","tags":null},"/Articles/Faith-Theory":{"title":"","content":"Any attempt to explain your faith could be called your \"Faith Theory.\" Like all theories, them more it can explain, the better it is.\n\nAn example of a bad Faith Theory might be \"It's all a lie.\" You might accept this theory because it explains some problems you've discovered with your faith. But any good Faith Theory must be able to explain as much as possible. \"It's all a lie\" can't explain the [very real miracles that follow the believers](https://www.latterdayhope.com/). \n\nSimilarly, \"It's all true\" is equally bad, because it can't explain the very real problems that we face in our religion.\n\nYour own Faith Theory is going to be built over time, bit by bit, and will need adjustment from time to time, just like a real scientific theory. As you learn new things you will refine your theories and hopefully find more and more truth.\n\n\u003e [!example] I often use the tern \"explanatory power\" when talking about people's theories for the church, our doctrines, and the members.  A good theory has to explain the most variables possible - have good \"explanatory power.\" If one of our variables is that [[Things We're Sure Of | God Loves Us]], then any theory has to take that into account to be truly viable.\n\nOur \"faith theory\" has to not just explain the faults in the Book of Mormon with the simple \"it's all made up\" but it has to explain the incredible evidences FOR authenticity. Neither \"It's **all** a lie\" nor \"it's **all** divine\" can do that.\n\nOur faith theory has to solve as much of the good and the bad that hangs over our belief system. To me, God choosing broken, flawed people to do his work is the only explanation that can account for the simultaneous divinity and brokenness of the restored gospel.","lastmodified":"2023-01-24T20:02:56.387790613Z","tags":null},"/Articles/Things-Were-Sure-Of":{"title":"","content":"When it comes to the restored gospel there are a lot of things that we call [[What is Doctrine | Doctrine]] but not everybody agrees on what is doctrine and what isn't. That means there's a bit of uncertainty or ambiguity, even on subjects that many of us feel are settled.\n\nWith that in mind, what are some teachings about which we feel at least somewhat certain? What are some things that can serve as a foundation for subjects of faith as well as for logical questioning and exploration of the restored gospel? \n\n## A Few \"Core Doctrines\" on Which We Can Hang Our Hats:\n\n* God is real\n* [[God loves us]]\n* God is fair\n* The priesthood is real\n* Revelation is real\n* We have agency\n* The scriptures can be a conduit for revelation\n* The scriptures can help us navigate our lives\n* The scriptures point us to Christ\n* Life has pupose and meaning\n* The Creation\n* The Fall\n* The Atonement\n* The Pre-Existence\n* The spirit world\n* The Resurrection\n* Judgement\n* The great apostasy\n* The restoration\n* God requires sacrifice from us\n* God gives commandments \n* We can speak to God through prayer\n* We worship God the Father in the name of Jesus Christ\n* Jesus Christ is our Savior from Sin and Death\n* Everyone requires repentance\n* Joseph Smith was a prophet\n\n## How do these \"Core Doctrines\" help us?\n\nThese things might serve as a part of our \"Creed of the Restored Gospel\", even though [[Joseph Smith]] said we don't have any creeds. üòï \n\nWith these and similar items of certainty we can begin to build a framework for our faith - a sort of [[Faith Theory]] which helps us find and evaluate truth in the doctrines of the Restored Gospel.  \n\n\u003e[!example]\n\u003eLet's say somebody tells you that God punishes people for not knowing his rules. Because you know that God loves us and is fair that this hypothesis is wrong and we should explore the situation again with those truths in mind.\n\nAs we make our lists of certainties - our premises in our arguments - we should be very careful before adding ANYTHING to the list. Some things we have believed our whole lives have never really been questioned or examined. Stuff that seems like an \"of course\" can crumble in the light of unbiased scrutiny. \n\n\u003e [!warning] Commandment Warning!\n\u003e It's common for our unexamined assumptions to pollute our pool of \"doctrines\" even when it comes to commandments. A great example is the common assumption made about the prohibition on drinking coffee and tea in the church. Too many people treat their idea that \"it's because of the caffiene\" as truth. But that so-called truth should not go on our list of certainties! \n\u003e   For more, read [\"The Why Behind Commandments\"](https://www.latterdayhope.com/the-whys-behind-commandments/)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-24T20:02:56.387790613Z","tags":null},"/Articles/Truth-Cart":{"title":"","content":"Historian Patrick Mason created a metaphor called a \"Truth Cart\" which is a way of visualizing the mental and psychological space we give to things we think are true. Here's how he puts it:\n\n\u003e One of the problems we have in Mormonism is that we have loaded too much into the¬†_Truth Cart_. And then when anything in the cart starts to rot a bit, or look unseemly upon further inspection, some have a tendency to¬†_overturn the entire cart_¬†or seek a refund for the whole lot. We have loaded so much into the Truth Cart largely because we have wanted to have the same kind of certainty about our religious claims‚Äîdown to rather obscure doctrinal issues‚Äîas we do about scientific claims. . . .  \n\u003e Over the years the church leadership and laity have also done our religion no favors by putting more in the cart than the cart could possibly bear. . . . Many of the things which trouble people are things that we probably should never have been all that dogmatic about in the first place. I find that a little humility about our doctrine, especially given the contingencies of its historical development, goes a long way in remaining satisfied with the whole. . . .  \n\u003e \\[anti-mormon hit pieces\\] are emblematic of this all-or-nothing approach to religion.\n\n## How antagonists to our faith use the truth cart against us\n\nmany ex-Mormons and anti-Mormons can‚Äôt resist opportunities to tell believers what their faith ‚Äúreally teaches.‚Äù Hear an ex-Mormon start a sentence with ‚Äúdid you know‚Äù and you can almost be certain he or she is about to try and educate you on an esoteric and negatively framed artifact from our religious history. Of course, this is nonsensical, since what is a person‚Äôs faith if not what they believe? Why then, do most anti-Mormon texts seek to inform us about the ‚Äúreal‚Äù religion, substituting our beliefs with theirs, and filling our truth carts with [[Anti-Doctrines]]? \n\nThey insist you must believe EVERYTHING ever said or speculated by any leader, ever (and especially the most negative interpretation of those things) or you believe NOTHING.\n\nIn essence, these people want you to believe that Mormonism must not only be everything that is true or thought to be true by yourself, but that you must load your cart high with everything ever said by an authority, throw a net over everything and bind it tightly down ‚Äì allowing none of it to escape. You must place [[What is Doctrine | everything ever taught]] into that cart from the obscure history to the forgotten speculation of leaders past; not just the things you personally know to be true. This hurts you in two terrible ways: it makes you easier to ‚Äútip‚Äù and it makes you stop moving forward as you focus on loading your cart ever higher.\n\n## What do we do with our wobbly Truth Carts?\n\nPhilosopher Adam Miller asks us a question about what we are thinking about our religion when things feel wobbly:\n\n\u003e Can you sacrifice what you *thought* was your religion as an act fidelity to that religion?  \n\u003e  \n\u003eAnd, then, having given it all back, having returned all your ideas about God and religion to God, can you still keep coming?  \n\u003e  \n\u003eCan you stay?  \n\u003e  \n\u003eIf your religion falls apart in your hands, don‚Äôt without further ado [assume that this is because your religion doesn‚Äôt work](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/10/it-works-wonderfully?lang=eng).  \n\u003e  \n\u003eRather, start by inquiring into whether that disintegration may not itself be the clearest manifestation yet of the fact that your religion *is* working. \n\nPerhaps those missing pieces or cracks in our self-made concept of religion are not to \"test us\" or require us to \"have faith\" or some other metaphysical reason, but to remove from us the responsibility of dealing with these kinds of issues at the expense of what really matters. To show us what kinds of things *should* get thrown out of the cart - away from our attention and focus.\n\nIn other words, we can't get distracted preaching to the world about our perfect leaders and our scientifically proven book and our certain doctrines if our religion is instead imperfect, unproven, and uncertain. It forces us to hang on to those things which [ARE real](https://www.latterdayhope.com/a-few-facts-about-the-latter-day-saints/), and [ARE meaningful](https://www.latterdayhope.com/a-few-facts-about-the-latter-day-saints-and-service/). \n\nOur religion was never about if skeletons in a field were Nephite or Mayan, or if prophets were always going to get answers to doctrinal questions right or not. It was never about the method of the translation of the Book of Mormon, or the racism or lack thereof of past members and leaders. \n\nPerhaps when those parts of our religion \"fall apart in our hands\" we can be free to realize \"this isn't what I was meant to focus on\" and finally open our attention to the [light that comes in through the cracks](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/tyler-j-jarvis/thats-light-gets/).

One of the most common and troublesome terms used by memebers of the restored church is \"Doctrine.\"\n\n## How We Define Doctrine Here\n\n\u003e [!info] Docrine literally means \"teaching.\"  Any **current teaching** of the church is therefore a \"doctrine\" of the church. \n\n### Implications:\n\n* Not every doctrine will be complete, up-to-date, or even true. \n* There is no difference between policy and doctrine.\n* Doctrines can change, be updated, expire, etc.\n* Doctrines can apply only temporarily, or to certain people.\n\n### Benefits:\n\n* This eliminates the urge to differentiate between doctrine and policy.\n* If used responsibly, we can differentiate between teachings of individuals and teachings of the church.\n* Since it's ALL doctrine, we no longer need to ask if it's \"official\" or not, we can just move on to the next step: asking \"how am I to act in response to this information?\"\n\n### Problems: \n\n* We have to think a lot more as we evaluate things we're taught. Did your sunday school teacher say polygamy is a requirement for exaltation? How about our modern prophets and apostles? It's a lot of work.\n* Bigger \"shelves.\" We have to accept a lot more often that we just don't know some things for sure and be okay with that. Putting answers to that question on hold can be challenging for some.\n* We can no longer comfortably say \"it's all true\" or \"it's all false.\" *\n\n## Why define doctrine this way?\n\nMost members seem to think of a doctrine as something unchanging, eternal, and true. However nowhere in the church do we have any kind of guide to our doctrines. What one person insists is doctrine is called speculation by another. Where one member sees a temporary church policy, another sees permanence.\n\nTherefore, if we're going to discuss our doctrines in an impartial way, we have to treat  them all impartially. This is the best way to do that without adding emotional or psychological baggage to our search for truth.\n\nThe hope is that we come out of this with the ability to accept all teachings equally, without downplaying some as \"mere policy,\" or opinion. But similarly we don't have to take every word said by every prophet ever and try to force it to fit in our over-burdened \"[[Truth Cart]].\"   \n\nInstead we learn a doctrine, recognize it for what it is, and rather than ask \"is this doctrine?? is this true??\" ask \"how do I need to live?\"\n\n## The Impermanence of Doctrine\n\nElder Anderson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles gave wonderful guidance on one of the ways we should filter through our teachings to figure out what teachings we should accept as Church teachings, instead of opinions, speculation, or expired doctrines:\n\n\u003e There is an important principle that governs the doctrine of the Church. The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. True principles are taught frequently and by many.\n\nThus two tools we have for finding truth in our doctrines are durability and consensus. \n\n### Durability\n\nDurability refers to how long a doctrine endures. For example, are modern prophets speaking about subjects that seemed important to earlier prophets? If not, those teachings lack durability. That may be a sign that those doctrines were temporary, aimed at a certain group, or just opinion rather than inspired. In a worst-case scenario, these can become [[Anti-Doctrines]].\n\n### Consensus\n\nToday our Church leaders have learned to find consensus on matters of policy and doctrine. Earlier leaders did not have the experience to know that the members of our faith will too easily accept opinion and speculation as eternal truth. A teaching from a single leader or a small number of leaders does not overcome the hurdle of consensus. That doesn't mean those doctrines aren't true, but it's a warning sign to dig deeper.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-24T20:02:56.387790613Z","tags":null},"/Doctrine/God-loves-us":{"title":"","content":"\u003e God does not now nor will He ever do to you a destructive, malicious, unfair thing‚Äîever.
