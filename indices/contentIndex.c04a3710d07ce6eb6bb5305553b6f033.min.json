The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. True principles are taught frequently and by many.\n\nTherefore, long-ago statements by church leaders, no matter how important they were, may not qualify as a doctrine of our faith if those statements haven't survived to be taught today by our leaders. \n\nIn other words, \"what the church really believes\" is what it teaches in public today, what the majority of members actually believe, and what we practice. It's not the random thoughts, speculation, or interpretation of cherry-picked statements from other flawed humans. \n\n## A Few Examples of Anti-Doctrine\n\n* Mormons believe they will get their own planet\n* People live on the moon and sun\n* Blood atonement\n* Women are destined to be making babies for eternity\n* The garden of eden was in missouri\n* You HAVE to be a polygamist in the next life\n* Skin color is a sign of a curse\n* Adam is God\n\nThe list goes on. Anybody trying to tell  you what \"Mormons Really Believe\" is making an effort to load more and more into your \"Truth Cart\" so it's easier to tip over. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T20:08:25.484911192Z","tags":null},"/Doctrine/Things-Were-Sure-Of":{"title":"","content":"When it comes to the restored gospel there are a lot of things that we call [[What is Doctrine | Doctrine]] but not everybody agrees on what is doctrine and what isn't. That means there's a bit of uncertainty or ambiguity, even on subjects that many of us feel are settled.\n\nWith that in mind, what are some teachings about which we feel at least somewhat certain? What are some things that can serve as a foundation for subjects of faith as well as for logical questioning and exploration of the restored gospel? \n\n## A Few \"Core Doctrines\" on Which We Can Hang Our Hats:\n\n* God is real\n* God loves us\n* God is fair\n* The priesthood is real\n* Revelation is real\n* We have agency\n* The scriptures can be a conduit for revelation\n* The scriptures can help us navigate our lives\n* The scriptures point us to Christ\n* Life has pupose and meaning\n* The Creation\n* The Fall\n* The Atonement\n* The Pre-Existence\n* The spirit world\n* The Resurrection\n* Judgement\n* God requires sacrifice from us\n* God gives commandments \n* We can speak to God through prayer\n* We worship God the Father in the name of Jesus Christ\n* Jesus Christ is our Savior from Sin and Death\n* Everyone requires repentance\n* Joseph Smith was a prophet\n\n## How do these \"Core Doctrines\" help us?\n\nThese things might serve as a part of our \"Creed of the Restored Gospel\", even though [[Joseph Smith]] said we don't have any creeds. üòï \n\nWith these and similar items of certainty we can begin to build a framework for our faith - a sort of [[Faith Theory]] which helps us find and evaluate truth in the doctrines of the Restored Gospel.  \n\n\u003e[!example]\n\u003eLet's say somebody tells you that God punishes people for not knowing his rules. Because you know that God loves us and is fair that this hypothesis is wrong and we should explore the situation again with those truths in mind.\n\nAs we make our lists of certainties - our premises in our arguments - we should be very careful before adding ANYTHING to the list. Some things we have believed our whole lives have never really been questioned or examined. Stuff that seems like an \"of course\" can crumble in the light of unbiased scrutiny. \n\n\u003e [!warning] Commandment Warning!\n\u003e It's common for our unexamined assumptions to pollute our pool of \"doctrines\" even when it comes to commandments. A great example is the common assumption made about the prohibition on drinking coffee and tea in the church. Too many people treat their idea that \"it's because of the caffiene\" as truth. But that so-called truth should not go on our list of certainties! \n\u003e   For more, read [\"The Why Behind Commandments\"](https://www.latterdayhope.com/the-whys-behind-commandments/)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T20:08:25.484911192Z","tags":null},"/Doctrine/What-is-Doctrine":{"title":"","content":"For the purposes of this project we need to define a few common terms. One of the most common and troublesome terms used by memebers of the restored church is \"Doctrine.\"\n\n## How We Define Doctrine Here\n\nDocrine literally means \"teaching.\"  Any **current teaching** of the church is therefore a \"doctrine\" of the church. \n\n### Implications:\n\n* Not every doctrine will be complete, up-to-date, or even true. \n* There is no difference between policy and doctrine.\n* Doctrines can change, be updated, expire, etc.\n* Doctrines can apply only temporarily, or to certain people.\n\n## Why define doctrine this way?\n\nMost members seem to think of a doctrine as something unchanging, eternal, and true. However nowhere in the church do we have any kind of guide to our doctrines. What one person insists is doctrine is called speculation by another. Where one member sees a temporary church policy, another sees permanance.\n\nTherefore, if we're going to discuss our doctrines in an impartial way, we have to treat  them all impartially. This is the best way to do that without adding emotional or psychological baggage to our search for truth.\n\nThe hope is that we come out of this with the ability to accept all teachings equally, without downplaying some as \"mere policy,\" or opinion. But similarly we don't have to take every word said by every prophet ever and try to force it to fit in our over-burdened \"Truth Carts.\"   \n\nInstead we learn a doctrine, recognize it for what it is, and rather than ask \"is this doctrine?? is this true??\" ask \"how do I need to live?\"\n\n## The Imperminance of Doctrine\n\nElder Anderson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles gave wonderful guidance on one of the ways we should filter through our teachings to figure out what teachings we should accept as Church teachings, instead of opinions, speculation, or expired doctrines:\n\n\u003e There is an important principle that governs the doctrine of the Church. The doctrine is taught by all 15 members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. It is not hidden in an obscure paragraph of one talk. True principles are taught frequently and by many.\n\nThus two tools we have for finding truth in our doctrines are durability and consensus. \n\n### Durability\n\nDurability refers to how long a doctrine endures. For example, are modern prophets speaking about subjects that seemed important to earlier prophets? If not, those teachings lack durability. That may be a sign that those doctrines were temporary, aimed at a certain group, or just opinion rather than inspired. In a worst-case scenario, these can become [[Anti-Doctrines]].\n\n### Consensus\n\nToday our Church leaders have learned to find consensus on matters of policy and doctrine. Earlier leaders did not have the experience to know that the members of our faith will too easily accept opinion and speculation as eternal truth. A teaching from a single leader or a small number of leaders does not overcome the hurdle of consensus. That doesn't mean those doctrines aren't true, but it's a warning sign to dig deeper.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T20:08:25.484911192Z","tags":null}}
